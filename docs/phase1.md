In Phase 1, we are simulating a satellite's natural dynamics in orbit and converting it into realistic telemetry data. We are logging the quaternions (orientation) and angular velocity at 10hz into a structured dataset. This becomes the basis and foundation for our next phases where we will be injecting faults and training our AI model.
